Employee Attrition Analysis and Prediction

This project analyzes employee attrition patterns and builds predictive models to identify key factors influencing turnover. Using Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn), I performed:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Identified trends in demographics, job roles, and satisfaction scores that correlate with attrition.

Predictive Modeling: Built classification models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Decision Tree) to predict attrition likelihood.

Model Evaluation: Compared models using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC to ensure reliability.

Visualization: Created clear, data-driven charts that highlight the strongest predictors of attrition.

ðŸ”¹ Outcome: Delivered actionable insights to HR teams, helping them design retention strategies by focusing on high-risk employee groups.
